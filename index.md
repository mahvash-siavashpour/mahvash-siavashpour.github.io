## About Me

I am a M.Sc. student at the University of Alberta, supervised by <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/">Dr. Osmar Zaiane</a>. My research interests include large language model (LLM) reasoning, conditional computation, anytime neural networks, and precision health.

I have 5+ years of experience spanning academic Machine Learning research, applied industry projects especializing on Large Language Models, NLP, Reinforcement Learning, and agentic AI.
